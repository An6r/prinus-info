# 🌟 Prinus.info — My Personal Website

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to the codebase behind [**prinus.info**](https://prinus.info) — a personal corner of the web made by me, **Maria Prinus**. I'm a release manager, software engineer, cat lover, and a fan of old furniture and genealogy 🐈📚🛠️

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This site is built with some of my favorite modern tools:

- ⚛️ **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** – the React framework for fast, modern websites
- 🧬 **React.js** – for dynamic UI bits
- 🎨 **SASS** – because CSS needs structure too
- 🔤 **TypeScript** – making JavaScript smarter and safer
- 🧑‍💻 **HTML** – the classic
- ☁️ **AWS Amplify** – hosting & deployment
- 🤖 **ChatGPT** – yup, this README was partially written with AI help (thanks, buddy!)

## 🎯 Goals

This project is my creative space and tech playground. It's meant to:

- Represent me both professionally and personally
- Be clean, multilingual (English, Russian, Belarusian)
- Share knowledge, stories, and style
- Be 100% mine — from layout to deployment

## 🙌 Contributions

Not looking for outside contributors right now, but feel free to fork or say hi if you're building something similar!
